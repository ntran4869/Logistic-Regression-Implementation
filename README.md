Final projects MATH 332 Nonlinear optimization. Implementing Logistic Regression from scratch based on Steepest Descent. 

This assignment contains three data sets that are based on four publicly available benchmarks, each representing a binary classification task:

1. banknotes.csv: A data set describing observed measurements about banknotes (i.e., cash) under an industrial print inspection camera.  The task in this data set is to predict whether a given bank note is authentic or a forgery.  The four attributes are each continuous measurements.  The label is 0 if the note is authentic, and 1 if it is a forgery. This data set comes the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication

2. occupancy.csv: A data set of measurements describing a room in a building for a Smart Home application.  The task in this data set is to predict whether or not the room is occupied by people.  Each of the five attributes are continuous measurements.  The label is 0 if the room is unoccupied, and a 1 if it is occupied by a person.  This data set comes the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+

3. diabetes.csv: An sklearn built in data set https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html
